reflections:

1. when N = 40; The cost is going is too high and the angle is erro nous. May be I should reduce the cost factors and see.
    When the cost multipliers reduce by 1/10th, it went fine to some extent but the angles went bad (more than 50 degreees).

    2. It looks like N play a bigger value. Set the N to 20 so that it is looking into 2 sec of data (dt = 0.1)
      Here it is going fine.

3. When N = 40 and dt = 0.05 sec (T = 2 sec). Here the throttle is always 1, and steering angle is constant at 0.19

4. When N = 20, dt = 0.1 , v = 40 it is fine. However whent he speed is 60, then it is going rouge with high steeing values (25 deg) and throttle 1

5. Did experimants with degree of polynomial (which may impact the cte and delta)

3. At curves way point translation is going rouge (going to the edges and outside of the road)at speeds 60 (working ok with speed 40). Something to look for what is the contributing factor for the
